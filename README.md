- Use <kbd>n</kbd> and <kbd>p</kbd> to quickly jump to the next/previous chapter

**Search**

1. Go to a verse in the current chapter
2. Jump to a specific book, chapter and verse. Chapter and verse are optional.
3. Search for words.

_Note 1:_ Every search in case-insensitive by default. Uppercase letters or an underscore("\_") makes it case-sensitive.
